# WRF_Nudging 

Scripts for WRF analysis nudging using surface and upper-air observation.

The two scripts (combineSurfaceToObs.sh and combineCobsToRdaobs.sh) were provided by H. Tian (tianheng@pku.edu.cn).  I made some modifications to them

An example of configuration file (namelist.oa) for running obsgrid.exe.
